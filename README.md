## Windows Server 2022 Compliance: Implementing Microsoft Security Baselines Aligned with NIST 800-53 and RMF

Scenario: ‚ÄúHarden a Windows Server 2022 in Azure using Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT) baselines; map to NIST 800‚Äë53 controls; produce POA&M.‚Äù

Controls used from NIST 800-53:

SC-7: 

## Steps Taken

## Step 1: Provision Azure VM

A Windows Server 2022 virtual machine was provisioned in Azure for the compliance hardening lab.

### Inbound Port Restriction (SC-7)
I created the VM with the image of a Windows Server 2022 Edition. 
Initially, the RDP rule allowed traffic from any IP. After deployment, I edited the NSG to restrict RDP to my public IP only, reducing exposure and aligning with NIST SC-7 (Boundary Protection).

- **Public Inbound Ports**: RDP (TCP 3389) only
**NSG Rule Modified**:
  - Original: Allowed RDP from any source IP
  - Hardened: Modified to allow **only my personal IP** for RDP (inbound)
  - **Description**: "Inbound RDP access limited to analyst‚Äôs trusted IP address for secure remote administration."
- **Other Inbound Traffic**: Denied by default

## Step 2: Pre-Baseline Evidence Collection

Before applying any Microsoft Security Baseline, I collected evidence of the system‚Äôs existing state. I did this through running a script on PowerShell as an admin.

### Collected Files:
- systeminfo.txt ‚Äî OS and environment details
- gpresult.html ‚Äî Group Policy applied to the system
- secpol.inf ‚Äî Local Security Policy export

### Screenshot:
- C:\evidence folder view
- Group Policy export file in browser

Scripts used:
- [collect-baseline-evidence.ps1](scripts/collect-baseline-evidence.ps1)


## Step 3: Downloading Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)

I downloaded the following components from the official Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit page:
- `Windows Server-2022-Security-Baseline.zip`
- `LGPO.zip`
- `PolicyAnalyzer.zip`

Extracted and organized in C:\baselines\SCT

## Step 4: Applying the Microsoft Security Baseline Using LGPO.exe

I applied Microsoft‚Äôs official security baseline for Windows Server 2022 using the LGPO tool. This imported and enforced local security policies in alignment with NIST 800-53 control families (AC, IA, AU, CM, SC). I restarted the VM to make sure the changes are applied correctly.
